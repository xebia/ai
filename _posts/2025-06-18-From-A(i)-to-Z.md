## (Near) future

Lots of things are happening in the AI space, a few things to keep an eye on:

- A2A (Agent to Agent)
- ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) from [BeeAI](https://github.com/i-am-bee)

A good starting point is here: [What does MCP, A2A, and ACP mean?](https://akka.io/blog/mcp-a2a-acp-what-does-it-all-mean)

Also SLIM (Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging), previously called AGP (Agent Gateway Protocol) is interesting. Find more information here: [SLIM](https://github.com/agntcy/slim).

[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) is another initative to keep an eye on, suggesting adding a markdown file to websites to provide LLM-friendly content. [Here is an example for GoFastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt).

Microsoft is also embracing MCP and adding support for a central server registry, server isolation and other security features. [Read the blogpost here](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/05/19/securing-the-model-context-protocol-building-a-safer-agentic-future-on-windows).
